## LeetCode - 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void getMinimumDifference(TreeNode* node, int& prevValue, int& res) {
        if(node == NULL)
            return;

        getMinimumDifference(node->left, prevValue, res);
        if(prevValue != -1)
            res = min(res, node->val - prevValue);
        prevValue = node->val;
        getMinimumDifference(node->right, prevValue, res);
        
    }

    int getMinimumDifference(TreeNode* root) {
        int res = 100000;
        int prev = -1; 
        getMinimumDifference(root, prev, res);

        return res;
    }
};

That's the the first observation that you should make this is not just regular binary tree.
So today let's solve the problem~
this property is recursive. It gonna be true for every subtree as well.
What is going to give us the smallest minimum?
Well we can do it the way I'm kind of doing it right now.
We'd end up doing that for every pair of nodes in the graph
How many nodes are in the graph?
How many pairs are there going to be?
This would be the worst case time complexity
There is anything we can use to our advantage.
The difference happens to be one.
We should compare values that are close together if want to minimize the difference.
We would only compare values that are adjacent to each other.
We can iterate through the values in sorted order.
It's called in order traversal on a binary search tree.
That's exactly what we would do
We have to keep track of what our previous node that we visited was
We end up actually visiting we're going to traverse all the way down to the left.
We're going to pop back up

## 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree


```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums, int low, int high) {
        if( low <= high ){
            int center = (high + low) / 2;
            TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[center]);
            root->left = sortedArrayToBST(nums, low, center-1);
            root->right = sortedArrayToBST(nums, center+1, high);
            return root;
        }
        return NULL;
            
    }

    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        return sortedArrayToBST(nums, 0, nums.size()-1);
    }
};

```

That's the the first observation that the elements are sorted in ascending order and we have to convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
We gonna use divided-conquar to solve this problem.
We can look at each subtree as this tree is bst.

This is going to tell us the subarray.
Basically the elements that we're using to create a tree.
What are we going to do?
We're going to remove this element or basically not consider it anymore because we're going to ceate a node from it.
I'm going to create with these elements a left subtree for our root node.
Let's recompute the mid. 
This is basically the base case. right left are together. Meaning mid is also going to be in this position.
This is the condition that we know that we've done something wrong.
